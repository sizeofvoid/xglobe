XGLOBE 0.5p1
This is an interim release of xglobe, for OpenBSD, based on improvements
I've made to the xglobe 0.5 release. Those improvements have been submitted
back to Thorsten, and should be in the official xglobe 0.6, for the most
part.

XGLOBE 0.5

ABOUT XGLOBE:

XGlobe displays the earth from your favourite point in space, similar to
Xearth. The difference is that XGlobe uses a world map image which is mapped
to the globe. This can look pretty good depending on the map.

This version includes a free map.
You can get other maps usable with XGlobe on the net. See README.maps
for details.

XGlobe should work correctly when using virtual screens especially with KDE
(use -kde option).


DERIVATIVE WORK:

Jerome Dumonteil has taken some of the XGlobe code to write WMGlobe, an applet
for the Windowmaker window manager which displays the earth in an icon.

For links to similar software see the XGlobe homepage.

INSTALLATION:

You need the Qt library (available at http://www.troll.no) version 1.4 or
later in order to build XGlobe.

- Edit the directory definitions in "Makefile"
- type "make" to build xglobe
- type "make install" to install the required files
- if you have the files map.bmp and mapnight.bmp type "make install-maps"

XGlobe is being developed on Linux. People have managed to build it on the
following additional platforms:

Solaris 2.5.1 (g++ 2.8.1)
Solaris 2.7 SPARC (poth, egcs 1.1.2 & Sunsoft 5.0 compilers)
NetBSD

If you are successful getting it to work on other platforms, please tell me so.


CONFIGURATION AND USE:

Configuration is done through command line options.
Type 'xglobe -help' for an explanation of these options.


USING CUSTOM MAPS:

- For the image to the mapped correctly, position 0°N 0°W must be in the
  center of the image and the latitude must be linear from 90°N to 90°S.

XGLOBE AND KDE:

Although the -kde switch works quite nice I have found out that killing the
task "kbgndwm" before starting XGlobe (without -kde) has the same effect and
saves some memory (because XGlobe needs an additional image buffer in KDE
mode).

CREDIT:

Thanks go out to Raoul Alonso, author of Ssystem (a Solar System simulator)
who created the map which is distributed with XGlobe. He used a material from
C. Thomas' site. Links can be found on the XGlobe homepage.

Jeff Jolley <jeff@radcyberzine.com> found quite a few maps on the net and
created the excellent "XGlobe Maps" web page at 
http://www.radcyberzine.com/xglobe/.

Andrew Sumner <andrew_sumner@bigfoot.com> submitted quite a few patches to
XGlobe.

The moon position code is taken from Hari Nair's XPlanet.

Without Kirk Lauritz Johnson's program "xearth" I probably wouldn't have
ever considered writing XGlobe.
