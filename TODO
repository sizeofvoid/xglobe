XGlobe currently has all the features I wanted. That doesn't mean 
it couldn't be improved:

- "don't show markers on dark side"-option
- rewrite the ugly map-interpolation code
- use autoconf and automake for an easier setup process
  (does anyone have a configure script for detecting qimgio?)
- read default options from .xgloberc

- write a nicer script which periodically fetches cloud data from the Earth &
  Moon Viewer page and invokes xglobe
