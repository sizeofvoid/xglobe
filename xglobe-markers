# Format:
# <latitude> <longitude> "Name" [color=<colorname>]
# positive latitude - north of equator
# negative latitude - south of equator
# positive longitude - west of 0° meridian
# negative longitude - east of 0° meridian
#
# optionally, color=<colorname> specifies the color of the marker,
# where <colorname> is either an X color name or an RGB value in HTML
# format (color=#RRGGBB, where RR, GG and BB are the RGB intensities as
# a hexadecimal value
#
# anything after a '#' and blank lines are ignored

# This file contains the "built-in" marker data that is compiled into
# xearth. (My apologies for misspellings, omissions of your favorite
# location, or geographic inaccuracies. This is primarily just a pile
# of data that I had handy instead of an attempt to provide a sample
# that is "globally correct" in some sense.)
